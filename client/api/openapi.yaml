        Create an External Card from token. The token and cardholder name are obtained through the iFrame. The token must be used within 5 minutes or else it will expire. If a Business ID is provided, address verification will be performed against the legal address of the business. Otherwise, the legal address of the Customer will be used. In either case, the name of the Customer will be used to match against the cardholder name.

        Each unique External Card is limited to a single Customer, so once an External Card is created for a Customer, it cannot be used for any other Customers, even if the card is deleted. Given there is a limited number of test cards, to allow easier testing, this restriction is relaxed in the sandbox environment.

        An internal transfer is an payment between two accounts within the same Fintech.

        By default, the payment is posted immediately. To indicate that you want to separate the authorization from the completion of the payment, use `capture_mode` = `MANUAL`. In that case, a separate call to update the status of the transfer will be required to complete the payment.

        * `ACCOUNT_BALANCE`: The posted balance of the account. For a banking account, e.g.

          posted transactions. For a lending account, e.g. `CHARGE_SECURED` or `LINE_OF_CREDIT`,
          this is a measure of the sum of debits minus credits for all posted transactions. This
          value can be negative.

        * `AVAILABLE_BALANCE`: The available balance of the account, which is the amount available
          to spend, or the spending power. For a banking account, e.g. `CHECKING` or `SAVING`, this
          is a measure of the account balance minus any pending debits. For an unsecured lending
          account, e.g. `CHARGE_UNSECURED` or `LINE_OF_CREDIT`, this is a measure of available
          credit, which is its credit limit minus the account balance, minus any pending debits.
          For a `CHARGE_SECURED` account, it equals the `AVAILABLE_BALANCE` of the linked
          security account. This value will never be negative.

        * `ACCRUED_INTEREST_MTD`: The amount of accrued but unposted interest. This value may
          fluctuate, as new transactions can affect interest amounts. Treat accrued interest as
          pending for the billing month until it is posted at the end of the billing period.

        \ One of the following:\n* `ACH_AUTHORIZATION` –\n    [US] The ACH Authorization\
        \ & Agreement Disclosure serves as a method of disclosing\n    and obtaining\
        \ consent from a consumer to conduct ACH and pre-authorized\n    electronic\
        \ transactions to and from their account. Record of obtaining this\n    consent\
        \ should be retained, in accordance with Reg E, for no less than 2 years\n\
        \    from the date the disclosure was made to the consumer.\n\n* `DIRECT_BILLING_AUTHORIZATION`\
        \ –\n    [US] Disclosure to certify that the user has authorized Synctera\
        \ to initiate ACH debits/credits to the specified settlement account.\n\n\
        * `CARDHOLDER_AGREEMENT` –\n    [US] The Cardholder Agreement is a legal document\
        \ that details the terms of a card\n    agreement between either a consumer\
        \ or a business, and the financial\n    institution that issues the card.\
        \ The Agreement governs the use of the\n    account.\n\n    [CA] A legal document\
        \ that details the terms of a customer’s use of a card and their relationship\n\
        \    with the issuing financial institution, Synctera (if applicable), and\
        \ the Distributor\n    of the Card (the FinTech). The Agreement governs the\
        \ customer’s use of the Card and the account,\n    including their rights\
        \ and obligations.\n\n\n* `CARD_DISCLOSURE` – \n    [CA] Part of the Cardholder\
        \ Agreement, the Disclosure highlights prescribed terms and\n    conditions\
        \ that apply to the customer's use of the Card. The Disclosure can be \n \
        \   incorporated into the Agreement itself, but is often shown separately\
        \ to ensure\n    clear understanding of the regulated terms.\n\n* `E_SIGN`\
        \ –\n    [US] US law with rules around electronic agreements/documents/disclosures:\n\
        \    used to obtain consent from consumers to receive electronic communications\n\
        \    (agreements, disclosures, statements, etc) about their accounts.\n\n\
        \    [CA] In order for you to send customers regulatory notices, disclosures,\
        \ and\n    documents electronically and to collect their consent electronically,\
        \ customers\n    need to acknowledge an Electronic Consent form. This should\
        \ happen first so the\n    disclosures that follow are acknowledged with the\
        \ customer’s consent to do so electronically.\n\n* `KYC_DATA_COLLECTION` –\
        \n    [US] Document advising the customer that you will collect their personal\
        \ information\n    (name, date of birth, tax ID, etc.)\n    and will be validating\
        \ their information against external data/documentation.\n\n* `PAD_AUTHORIZATION`\
        \ – \n    [CA] You must record a customer's authorization prior to facilitating\
        \ a pre-authorized\n    EFT debit transaction. This form records their authorization\
        \ for you to facilitate \n    future EFTs from their account. This can be\
        \ a sporadic or recurring PAD; if sporadic, \n    you need to confirm the\
        \ customer's authorization prior to each future transaction.\n\n* `PRIVACY_NOTICE`\
        \ –\n    [US] Document that tells customers what is done with their non-public\
        \ information,\n    who it is shared with, how is is secured,\n    and how\
        \ they can opt out of it being shared beyond Synctera.\n\n    [CA] It is a\
        \ requirement for you to disclose to customers how you collect, use,\n   \
        \ disclose, and store their personal information, including how information\
        \ is shared\n    with third parties like Synctera, what their rights are,\
        \ and how they can withdraw\n    their consent. You must collect explicit\

        Creating and retrieving encrypted documents requires documents_encrypted:write and documents_encrypted:read permissions, respectively.

        If encryption is not specified, a default will be chosen based on the document type. See the following table.

        Document types with a default of REQUIRED must be encrypted. It is an error to explicitly set encryption to NOT_REQUIRED for these document types.

        Document types with a default of NOT_REQUIRED may optionally be encrypted by explicitly setting encryption to REQUIRED.

      description: |-
        Synctera error responses in API v0 follow [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807). Following that standard, the field for a machine-readable "error code" in API v0 is `type`.
        In our future API v1, we are phasing out RFC 7807 and adopting a custom error format. That format will be documented in our API v1 spec. But you may see some v0 error responses with a machine-readable `code` field while we are making the transition from v0 to v1.
      properties:
        code:
          description: An optional “sneak preview” of our future API v1 error responses.
            This is provided to give integrators a chance to work with our future
            error codes. Error codes for the same error may change between v0 and
            v1.
          example: BAD_REQUEST_BODY
          type: string
        detail:
          description: |
            A human-readable string explaining this particular error.
          example: "missing required fields: first_name, dob"
          type: string
        status:
          description: the HTTP status code for this response
          example: 400
          type: integer
        title:
          description: |
            A human-readable string for this general category of error, which corresponds 1-to-1 with error types (`title` is the human-readable version of `type`). There can be multiple distinct titles for the same HTTP status code, and the same `title` can result in many different `detail` strings.
            This field will be removed in API v1.
          example: Bad Request Body
          type: string
        type:
          description: |
            A machine-readable string that identifies the error for programmatic use. This is a URI, i.e. a globally unique identifier. It is _not_ necessarily a URL, so do not expect it to resolve to a web page. You can use this whole string as an error code, or just everything after the last slash.
            This field will be removed in API v1.
